This directory contains the config files and deployment scripts for the official
riot.im distribution of Riot Web at https://riot.im.

You probably do not want to build with this config unless you're building the
official riot.im distribution, but these files may be useful if you want to
inspect the configuration used there.

Riot Desktop uses a separate config (see electron_app/riot.im/config.json).

Deployment scripts (such as app/deploy.py) are meant to be run on the web server
hosting the Riot installation.
